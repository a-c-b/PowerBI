# PowerBI
Repo to hold the PowerBI file

I was asked to create a visualization using PowerBI.  I have to say I am unimpressed with this tool.  It lacks the flexibility found in Excel or PowerPoint, with SQL Services Reporting, or with pretty much any other Microsoft product.  It looks like its target audience would be a user who doesn't know how to create visualizations on their own.  However, this two page demonstration of charting and mapping was created in less than 30 minutes from the time I unzipped the software to playing with what little formatting functions were available.  

The data file can be pulled down, but you will need to have PowerBI loaded in order to view.
