# PowerBI
Repo to hold the PowerBI file

I was asked to create a visualization using PowerBI.  To do that I used two Excel files from the Dancing Dog business plan: one with the 11,693 data points on the liquor pricing and the other with mapped addresses.  The object of this exercise was to demonstrate how quickly I could be up and running with PowerBI, and with that product's lack of formatting flexibility, the answer was "lickety-split." This two page demonstration of charting and mapping was created in less than 30 minutes from the time I unzipped the software to playing with what little formatting functions were available.  

The data file can be pulled down, but you will need to have PowerBI loaded in order to view.
